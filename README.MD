# plasma-theme â€” a KDE Plasma theme switcher

Quickly change plasma color schemes and widget styles from the command-line.

---

## Installation

Grab the binary from the [latest release](https://github.com/maldoinc/plasma-theme-switcher/releases) and move it to a directory within the path.

## Why not use lookandfeeltool?

Lookandfeeltool currently has no option to allow only partial application of a theme. What this tool will do for you is change color scheme, widget style and leave the rest of your desktop intact without changing splash screens, cursors etc.
